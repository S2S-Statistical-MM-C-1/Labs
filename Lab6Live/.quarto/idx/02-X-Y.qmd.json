Draw $m=$ 20,000 samples of size $n_X=$ 120 from the distribution $X\\sim N(90,\\,12)$ and calculate the mean of each of these samples.\n2. Draw $m=$ 20,000 samples of size $n_Y=$ 96 from the distribution $Y\\sim N(40,\\,10)$ and calculate the mean of each of these samples.\n3. Calculate the difference between the sample means from the distribution for $X$ and from the distribution for $Y$ - that is $\\bar X-\\bar Y$.\n4. Check whether the kernel density estimate of the distribution of these differences is similar to the expected normal distribution, as stated above.\n\n:::{.question}\n::::{.question-header}\nTask\n::::\n::::{.question-container}\nUsing the statement above about the distribution of $\\bar X-\\bar Y$, what distribution would you expect the differences in sample means to follow?\n\n<!--\n```{r mcq-opts3, echo=FALSE}\nopts3 <- sample(c(answer = \"$N\\\\Big(50,\\\\,\\\\sqrt{\\\\textstyle\\\\frac{12^2}{120}+\\\\textstyle\\\\frac{10^2}{96}}\\\\Big)$\",\n           \"$N\\\\Big(50,\\\\,\\\\sqrt{\\\\textstyle\\\\frac{12}{120}+\\\\textstyle\\\\frac{10}{96}}\\\\Big)$\",\n           \"$N\\\\Big(50,\\\\,\\\\sqrt{\\\\textstyle\\\\frac{12^2}{20,000}+\\\\textstyle\\\\frac{10^2}{20,000}}\\\\Big)$\",\n           \"$N\\\\Big(90,\\\\,\\\\sqrt{\\\\textstyle\\\\frac{12^2}{120}+\\\\textstyle\\\\frac{10^2}{96}}\\\\Big)$\"), size = 4)\n```\n\n`r longmcq(opts3)`\n\n`r hide(\"Solution\")`\nWe know that $X\\sim N(90,\\,12)$ and that we want to take samples of size 120 from this distribution.

We use a data frame, rather than a vector here, so that we can go on to plot the distribution of differences using `ggplot2`.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n```{r XY2}\nXY <- data.frame(diff = meansX - meansY)\n```\n:::\n\nFinally, we can use `ggplot2` to plot the kernel density estimate of the differences between each pair of sample means from the $N(90,\\,12)$ and $N(40,\\,10)$ distributions. We do this using the `geom_density()` function.\n\nWe know that $\\bar X-\\bar Y$ follows the $N\\Big(50,\\,\\sqrt{\\textstyle\\frac{12^2}{120}+\\textstyle\\frac{10^2}{96}}\\Big)$ distribution, so we can superimpose this above the kernel density estimate to assess how similar they are. We do this by including the layer `stat_function()`. Because the distribution we want to show is a normal distribution, we use the argument `fun = dnorm`. The mean and standard deviation, $50$ and $\\sqrt{\\textstyle\\frac{12^2}{120}+\\textstyle\\frac{10^2}{96}}$ respectively, are included within a list given to the argument `args =`. We can also set some stylistic choices of how this normal distribution should appear using the `col =`, `linetype =`, `fill =`, `alpha =` and `geom =` arguments.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n```{r XY3.1, eval = FALSE}\nggplot(data = XY) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = diff), fill = \"cadetblue3\") +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 50,\n                sd = sqrt(12^2/120 + 10^2/96)),\n                geom = \"area\", col = \"black\", linetype = 2,\n                fill = \"black\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  labs(x = expression(bar(X)-bar(Y)), y = \"Density\")\n```\n\n## Plots\n```{r XY3.2, echo = FALSE}\nggplot(data = XY) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = diff), fill = \"cadetblue3\") +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 50, sd = sqrt(12^2/120 + 10^2/96)),\n                geom = \"area\", col = \"black\", linetype = 2, fill = \"black\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  labs(x = expression(bar(X)-bar(Y)), y = \"Density\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::{.question}\n::::{.question-header}\nTask\n::::\n::::{.question-container}\nDo you think the kernel density estimate of the distribution of the differences between pairs of sample means is approximately equal to the $N\\Big(50,\\,\\sqrt{\\textstyle\\frac{12^2}{120}+\\textstyle\\frac{10^2}{96}}\\Big)$ distribution?\n\n<!--`r mcq(c(answer=\"Yes\", \"No\", \"Can't say\"))`-->\n::::\n:::\n\n<!--computing empirical and theoretical probability-->\nWe can use our calculated differences between the sample means of $X$ and $Y$ to estimate probabilities for $\\bar X-\\bar Y$. For example, you might be asked, what is the probability that the difference between the mean of $X$ and the mean of $Y$ is greater than 48?\n\nWe can use the values of differences between the pairs of sample means to answer this. We use a logical statement, `XY$diff > 48`, to identify which of the calculated differences are greater than 48. This logical statement returns 20,000 values - `TRUE` if the corresponding difference was greater than 48 and `FALSE` if the difference was less than or equal to 48. We can then plug this logical vector into the `mean()` function to tell us the proportion of differences that were greater than 48. This proportion is a good approximation of the true probability $P\\big(\\bar X-\\bar Y>48\\big)$ and using the code below, we see that this is roughly equal to `r mean(XY$diff > 48)`.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n```{r XY4.1, eval = FALSE}\nmean(XY$diff > 48)\n```\n\n## Output\n```{r XY4.2, echo = FALSE}\nmean(XY$diff > 48)\n```\n:::\n\nBecause we have used our samples to calculate this probability, this is known as an *empirical* probability. We could also find the true, theoretical probability that $P\\big(\\bar X-\\bar Y>48\\big)$ by using the fact that $\\bar X-\\bar Y\\sim N\\Big(50,\\,\\sqrt{\\textstyle\\frac{12^2}{120}+\\textstyle\\frac{10^2}{96}}\\Big)$.\n\nWe can use the function `pnorm()` to find the probability that $P\\big(\\bar X-\\bar Y\\leq 48\\big)$. Then, in order to find $P\\big(\\bar X-\\bar Y>48\\big)$, we simply calculate $1-$ the result from `pnorm()`. This is shown in the code below.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n```{r XY5.1, eval = FALSE}\n1-pnorm(48, mean = 50, sd = sqrt(12^2/120 + 10^2/96))\n```\n\n## Output\n```{r XY5.2, echo = FALSE}\n1-pnorm(48, mean = 50, sd = sqrt(12^2/120 + 10^2/96))\n```\n:::\n\nNotice how close the empirical probability we calculated from our samples is to the true, theoretical probability.\n\n---\n\nYou can follow a similar example of using R to create a sample sampling distribution for $\\bar X-\\bar Y$ in Section [6.5.2 Sampling Distribution for $\\bar X-\\bar Y$ When
