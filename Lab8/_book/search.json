    "text": "When writing a formal statistical report, there is a typical structure that helps ensure all relevant information is included in a sensible way. By using the following sections, your report will flow well and detail your analysis in full.\nA template for a general statistical report, using the following structure, is included at the top of the Lab section on Moodle which you can always use for reference.\n\n\nIntroduction: this is where you should write a short description of the problem and provide context such as the data and variables collected. The aims of the analysis should also be clearly stated here.\nExploratory Analysis: this is where you should include appropriate summary statistics and plots you’ve created from the data. These should provide an initial impression and informally answer the aims of your analysis. Any tables and/or figures included should always be clearly captioned.\nStatistical Analysis: this is where the aims of the analysis will be formally answered. Describe the statistical methods and techniques you will use to analyse the data and detail any assumption you are making about the data. Include any relevant output from the analysis you’ve completed (you should not include any code from your R script in a report) and interpret the output in the context of the problem.\nConclusion: use your interpretation to provide an answer to the aims of the analysis. Discuss how this formal conclusion compares to the initial impressions of the data from the Exploratory Analysis and discuss any limitations in your analysis, for example, are there any other techniques you may use in further analysis to provide a better result?\n\n\nIn this lab we will focus on sections (1) and (2) of the report. Sections (3) and (4) will be discussed in Lab 9.\n\n\nTask\n\n\nFor this lab, we want to start to produce a statistical report detailing the analysis we will work through. A template for a general statistical report is provided on Moodle. Download this template and save it somewhere you are able to access it. We will add to the template throughout this lab.",

They measure the yield (in tonnes) from each field.\nAn additional 80 potato fields and 120 wheat fields were left unfertilised and the yields of crops from these fields was also recorded (in tonnes).\nThe farmers want to use the yields they have measured from their fields to assess whether the fertiliser has any significant affect on their crop yields.",

Then, set your working directory in R to point to wherever you have saved this file. For a reminder on setting your working directory, see Lab 3 Section 2.1.\nTo load the data frame into the Environment tab and call it yields, we can use the code below.\nIt is always good practise to open the original file to check, for example, for any missing values and the column headings used. Make sure to check that the data frame is saved in R as you would expect. Once you have read yields into your R session, we should explore its contents.\nWe can see that there are 3 columns in yields,\nBecause fertiliser and crop are columns of categorical data, we should switch them to be factors.

This can be numeric or logical.\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\nUse the function mean() to find the mean yield of potatoes from each type of field, and the mean yield of wheat from each type of field.\nWithin the Exploratory Analysis section of your report, include the values you calculate in a table similar to the one below.

A histogram allows us to roughly see the spread of the distribution of potato yields from the sample and consider things such as,\n\nwhether the population means of the two groups might be equal.\nif the population standard deviations look approximately equal between the groups.\n\nThe code below can be used to create two side-by-side histograms of potato yields from fertilised and unfertilised fields.

Then, once you click Copy Plot it is ready to paste wherever you need it.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to formally looking for a statistical difference between the mean potato yields from the two types of field (we’ll look at this in depth in Lab 9), it may be useful to know whether the yields from both types of field follow a normal distribution. We could use the histograms produced above to comment on this assumption of normality, but another useful to plot to show is a QQ plot.\nThe code below produces two side-by-side QQ plots; one for the potato yields from fertilised fields and one for the potato yields from unfertilised fields.\n\nR CodePlots\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\n\nqqnorm(y = potato_fertilised$yield,\n       main = \"Potato Yield from Fertilised Fields\")\nqqline(y = potato_fertilised$yield)\n\nqqnorm(y = potato_unfertilised$yield,\n       main = \"Potato Yield from Unfertilised Fields\")\nqqline(y = potato_unfertilised$yield)\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\nHow would you describe the normality of potato yields from fertilised and unfertilised fields from the sample?\n\n The potato yield from fertilised fields seems to reasonably follow a normal distribtion, whereas the potato yield from unfertilised fields does not.
