## Reading in the data

The observed yields can be found in the file *yields.csv*.

To read *yields.csv* into R, you will first need to download it from [Moodle](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=4944039){target="_blank"} and save it somewhere accessible. Then, set your working directory in R to point to wherever you have saved this file. For a reminder on setting your working directory, see [Lab 3 Section 2.1](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9073238/mod_resource/content/4/01-reading.html#directory){target="_blank"}.

To load the data frame into the **Environment** tab and call it `yields`, we can use the code below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
yields <- read.csv("data/yields_long.csv")
```

::: panel-tabset
## R Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
yields <- read.csv(file = "yields.csv")
```
:::

It is always good practise to open the original file to check, for example, for any missing values and the column headings used. Make sure to check that the data frame is saved in R as you would expect. Once you have read `yields` into your R session, we should explore its contents.

::: panel-tabset
## R Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
head(yields)
```

## Output

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(yields)
```
:::

We can see that there are 3 columns in `yields`,

-   `fertiliser`: this is a categorical variable stating whether fertiliser was used or not in the field.

-   `crop`: this is a categorical variable stating whether the crop grown in the field was potatoes or wheat.

-   `yield`: this is the yield (in tonnes) of the crop harvested from each field.

<!---   `supermarket`: this is a binary variable; a 1 indicates that the yield from that particular field has been sold to supermarkets and a 0 indicates that the field's yield has been sold elsewhere or kept.-->

Because `fertiliser` and `crop` are columns of categorical data, we should switch them to be factors. In the code below, note that the argument `levels =` is used with `fertiliser` and `crop` because they are already labelled in the dataset<!--, however the argument `labels =` is used with `supermarket` to relabel each observation from a 0 or 1.-->

::: panel-tabset
## R Code

```{r}
yields$fertiliser <- factor(x = yields$fertiliser, 
                            levels = c("Used", "Not used"))

yields$crop <- factor(x = yields$crop, 
                      levels = c("potato", "wheat"))
```
:::

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#yields$supermarket <- factor(x = yields$supermarket,
#                             labels = c("elsewhere", "supermarket"))
```

## Summary statistics

Since we are interested in finding any differences between the mean yields of potatoes from fertilised and unfertilised fields, it makes sense to split the data into distinct subsets. `potato_fertilised` and `potato_unfertilised`, created using the code below, store the potato yields where fertiliser was used and fertiliser was not used respectively.

::: panel-tabset
## R Code

```{r}
potato_fertilised <- subset(x = yields,
                            subset = (fertiliser == "Used" & crop == "potato"))

potato_unfertilised <- subset(x = yields,
                              subset = (fertiliser == "Not used" & crop == "potato"))
```
:::

::: question
::: question-header
Task
:::

::: question-container
Similarly, we are interested in differences between the mean yields of wheat from fertilised and unfertilised fields.

Create two subsets, `wheat_fertilised` which stores the wheat yields from fields where fertiliser was used, and `wheat_unfertilised` which stores the wheat yields from fields where fertiliser was not used.

`r hide("Solution")`

::: panel-tabset
## R Code

```{r}
wheat_fertilised <- subset(x = yields,
                           subset = (fertiliser == "Used" & crop == "wheat"))

wheat_unfertilised <- subset(x = yields,
                             subset = (fertiliser == "Not used" & crop == "wheat"))
```
:::

`r unhide()`
:::
:::

Now that we have sensible subsets from the data, we can summarise the yield of crops from each type of field in some way. It would be appropriate to find the sample mean yield, for example, in each case and present these in a table within the statistical report.

The `mean()` function can be used to find the mean of a vector of numerical values. The only argument that the `mean()` function takes is,

-   `x =`: this is the vector of values to calculate the mean of. This can be numeric or logical.

::: question
::: question-header
Task
:::

::: question-container
Use the function `mean()` to find the mean yield of potatoes from each type of field, and the mean yield of wheat from each type of field.

Within the **Exploratory Analysis** section of your report, include the values you calculate in a table similar to the one below. Make sure to caption your table appropriately, and write a short paragraph which introduces where these values come from.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(Crop = c("Potato", "Wheat"), Fertilised = c("", ""), Unfertilised = c("", "")) %>%
  column_to_rownames("Crop") %>%
  kable(table.attr = 'data-quarto-disable-processing="true"; style="width:50%;"') %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped")) %>%
  kable_paper(position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE)
```

`r hide("Solution")`

In order to find the mean yield in each case we're interested in, the following code can be used.

::: panel-tabset
## R Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean(x = potato_fertilised$yield)
mean(x = potato_unfertilised$yield)
mean(x = wheat_fertilised$yield)
mean(x = wheat_unfertilised$yield)
```

## Output

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mean(potato_fertilised$yield)
mean(potato_unfertilised$yield)
mean(wheat_fertilised$yield)
mean(wheat_unfertilised$yield)
```
:::

These values can then be rounded to 2 decimal places and input into a table in the report such as,

```{r tbl-yield_means, echo = FALSE}
#| label: tbl-yield_means
#| tbl-cap: Sample mean yield of potato and wheat yields from fields where fertiliser was and was not used.

data.frame(Crop = c("Potato", "Wheat"), 
           Fertilised = c(round(mean(potato_fertilised$yield), 2),
                          round(mean(wheat_fertilised$yield), 2)), 
           Unfertilised = c(round(mean(potato_unfertilised$yield), 2), 
                            round(mean(wheat_unfertilised$yield), 2))) %>%
  column_to_rownames("Crop") %>%
  kable(table.attr = 'data-quarto-disable-processing="true"; style="width:50%;"') %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped")) %>%
  kable_paper(position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE)
```

For any output we include in the **Exploratory Analysis** section of the statistical report, we want to explain the initial impressions that this output provides and what we might then expect a formal answer to the aims to be. We can use @tbl-yield_means to informally compare the yield of each crop in the presence and absence of fertiliser.

We are also interested in the population proportion of crops that the farmers might expect to sell to supermarkets.

## Exploratory plots

In order to informally answer the [aims](02-intro.qmd#sec-aims) of our analysis, it is also a good idea to produce some appropriate plots that will graphically summarise the information contained in the data. For a reminder of how to create various plots in R, see [Lab 4](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9073320/mod_resource/content/6/index.html){target="_blank"}.

### Aim 1

**Is there a difference between the mean yields of potatoes from fields that were fertilised and fields that were unfertilised?**

::: question
::: question-header
Task
:::

::: {.question-container .webex-check}
```{r MCQ3, echo=FALSE}
optsQ3.1 <- c("Barplots", answer = "Histograms", "Pie charts")
optsQ3.2 <- c(answer = "Kernel density estimates", "Dot charts")
optsQ3.3 <- c(answer = "Boxplots")
```

What might some sensible plots for summarising the yield of potatoes from the two types of fields be? `r longmcq(sample(c(optsQ3.1, optsQ3.2, optsQ3.3)))`
:::
:::

To investigate our first aim, we will use a histogram here but there are other sensible options for presenting quantitative data. A histogram allows us to roughly see the spread of the distribution of potato yields from the sample and consider things such as,

-   whether the population means of the two groups might be equal.

-   if the population standard deviations look approximately equal between the groups.

The code below can be used to create two side-by-side histograms of potato yields from fertilised and unfertilised fields. So that they are comparable, the binwidths and range of the axes are forced to be the same. This is done by specifying the same sequence in the `breaks =` argument and the same range of the y-axis in the `ylim =` argument for both histograms.

::: panel-tabset
## R Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))

hist(x = potato_fertilised$yield,
     breaks = seq(from = 25, to = 50, by = 2.5),
     col = "darkseagreen",
     ylim = c(0, 30),
     main = "Potato Yield from Fertilised Fields",
     xlab = "Yield (tonnes)")

hist(x = potato_unfertilised$yield,
     breaks = seq(from = 25, to = 50, by = 2.5),
     col = "darkseagreen1",
     ylim = c(0, 30),
     main = "Potato Yield from Unfertilised Fields",
     xlab = "Yield (tonnes)")

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

## Plots

The code below produces two side-by-side QQ plots; one for the potato yields from fertilised fields and one for the potato yields from unfertilised fields.

### Aim 2

**Is there a difference between the mean yields of wheat from fields that were fertilised and fields that were unfertilised?**

Our second aim is similar to the first, but focuses on wheat yields rather than potato yields. Therefore, the same type of plots will be useful to us here, as long as this time they are produced using the subsets `wheat_fertilised` and `wheat_unfertilised` created earlier.

A histogram of wheat yield from fertilised fields and from unfertilised fields will allow us to consider things such as,

-   whether the population means of the two groups seem to be equal

-   if the population standard deviations look approximately equal between the groups.

The code below creates two side-by-side histograms of wheat yields from fertilised and unfertilised fields. The binwidths used, set by the `break =` argument, and the range of the y-axis, set by the `ylim =` argument, are kept consistent across the two histograms so they are comparable.

::: panel-tabset

```{r, eval = FALSE}

### Aim 3

**What proportion of field's yields might the farmers expect to sell to supermarkets?**

The variable `supermarket` within the `yields` dataset is a *qualitative* variable since it is categorical and shows whether the yield from a particular field has been sold to supermarkets or not. Therefore, to summarise graphically, we need to think about appropriate plots for qualitative data.

One such graph could be a barplot. The code below can be used to first create a table showing the proportion of the total number of fields which have their yields both sold and not sold to supermarkets. This is done using the `table()` and the `prop.table()` functions.

::: panel-tabset
## R Code
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#supermarket_props <- prop.table(table(yields$supermarket))
#supermarket_props
```
## Output
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#supermarket_props <- prop.table(table(yields$supermarket))
#supermarket_props
```
:::

Then, this table `supermarket_props` is used to create a barplot which visually shows the proportion of fields' yields that were sold to supermarkets and the proportion that were sold elsewhere.

::: panel-tabset
## R Code
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#barplot(height = supermarket_props,
#        main = "Proportion of Yields Sold to Supermarkets",
#        xlab = "Sold To",
#        ylab = "Proportion")
```
## Plots

Save your statistical report so far. It should now contain a full **Introduction** and **Exploratory Analysis** section.

We will add to the same statistical report in Lab 9 by working on the **Statistical Analysis** and **Conclusion**.

So far, we have seen from the exploratory analysis that:

-   the sample mean yield of potatoes from fertilised and from unfertilised fields are approximately equal.

-   the sample standard deviations of potatoes from fertilised and from unfertilised fields are approximately equal.

-   the yields of potatoes from fertilised and unfertilised fields both approximately follow a normal distribution.

-   the sample mean yield of wheat from fertilised is greater than the sample mean yield of wheat from unfertilised fields.

-   the sample standard deviation of wheat yields from fertilised fields is greater than the sample standard deviation of wheat yields from unfertilised fields.

-   the yields of wheat from fertilised and unfertilised fields both approximately follow a normal distribution.
