This lab will begin by introducing the structure that a formal statistical report should follow. This will partly include plotting techniques introduced in [Lab 4](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9073320/mod_resource/content/6/index.html){target=\"_blank\"} which will be revisited in order to explore a new data set visually.\n\nWe will also look at good styles of report writing and discuss what should be included in a statistical report.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- question callout example\n:::{.question}\n::::{.question-header}\nQuestion\n::::\n::::{.question-container}\nThis is where the question text would go.\n::::\n:::\n-->\n```\n",
