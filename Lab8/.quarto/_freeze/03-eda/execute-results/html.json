Therefore, to summarise graphically, we need to think about appropriate plots for qualitative data.\n\nOne such graph could be a barplot. The code below can be used to first create a table showing the proportion of the total number of fields which have their yields both sold and not sold to supermarkets. This is done using the `table()` and the `prop.table()` functions.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#supermarket_props <- prop.table(table(yields$supermarket))\n#supermarket_props\n```\n:::\n## Output\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThen, this table `supermarket_props` is used to create a barplot which visually shows the proportion of fields' yields that were sold to supermarkets and the proportion that were sold elsewhere.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#barplot(height = supermarket_props,\n#        main = \"Proportion of Yields Sold to Supermarkets\",\n#        xlab = \"Sold To\",\n#        ylab = \"Proportion\")\n```\n:::\n## Plots\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n:::\n\nWe can use the barplot to informally compare the proportion of fields' yields which are sold to supermarkets and which end up elsewhere.\n\n::: question\n::: question-header\nTask\n:::\n::: question-container\nAdd the bar plot created in R to the **Exploratory Analysis** section of your statistical report.
