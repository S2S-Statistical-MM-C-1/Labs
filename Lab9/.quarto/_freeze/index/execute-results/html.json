Today we will complete the statistical report that we started in [Lab 8](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9502911/mod_resource/content/2/){target=\"_blank\"} by completing the **Statistical Analysis** and **Conclusion** sections. If you have completed Lab 8, you should have the beginnings of a statistical analysis report saved.\n\nWe will take a look at different ways of calculating **confidence intervals** in different scenarios in R, which will allow us to complete the statistical report.\n\n<!-- question callout example\n:::{.question}\n::::{.question-header}\nQuestion\n::::\n::::{.question-container}\nThis is where the question text would go.\n::::\n:::\n-->\n\n<!--\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Script\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Console\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n:::\n-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
