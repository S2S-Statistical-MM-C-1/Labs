## Exercise 1 {-}

The file "*NHSScotland.txt*" contains data on the number of patients attending A&E every month in each of the 14 Scottish NHS boards, from 2007 up to 2023. This data set has the following variables:

* "Date": the end of the month that patient numbers are aggregated over.
* "NHSBoard": the Scottish NHS board the patients are from.
* "TotalAttendances": the total number of patients attending A&E in a given month and NHS board.
* "Within4Hours": the number of patients whose wait time was less than 4 hours.
* "Over4Hours": the number of patients whose wait time was greater than 4 hours.
* "Over8Hours": the number of patients whose wait time was greater than 8 hours.
* "Over12Hours": the number of patients whose wait time was greater than 12 hours.

a. i. Read "*NHSScotland.txt*" into R and save it as a data frame called `nhs`.
      
   ii. Change the column "NHSBoard" to be a factor. (**Hint**: you can see the names of all the Scottish NHS boards using the code `unique(nhs$NHSBoard)`.)

   iii. Add an additional column to `nhs` which calculates the percentage of total patients in A&E whose wait time is less than 4 hours. Call this new variable "PercentageWithin4Hours".

   iv. What is the average percentage of patients who had to wait less than 4 hours in each of the 14 Scottish NHS boards? (**Hint**: think how you can use the `tapply()` function.)

b. i. Create a new data frame, called `glasgow`, which is a subset of `nhs`. This data set should only show observations from NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde, as well as only having the variables "Date", "TotalAttendances" and "Over4Hours".

   ii. Sort `glasgow` in order of decreasing number of patients who had to wait more than 4 hours in A&E. When did the greatest number of patients have to wait for longer than 4 hours?
   
c. The file "*HBPopulation.csv*" contains data relating to the population size (in 2021) of each of the 14 Scottish NHS boards. Read this file into R and save it as a data frame called `population`.

   After reading @sec-merge, merge `nhs` and `population` so that A&E attendance and the health board population size can be seen in the same data frame.
