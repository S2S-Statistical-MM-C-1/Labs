```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, comment=NA)

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

If you are unable to download and install RStudio on to your own device, don't worry! It is possible to access RStudio on the University's Virtual Desktop, called **Glasgow Anywhere Desktop**.

To do this, follow this [link](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/anywhere/desktop/) and select the '*Connect to Glasgow Anywhere Desktop via your web browser*'. You will need to log in using your student email and password and then select the '*Student Desktop*'. This will open a Windows desktop in your browser - the same one you would see on a PC in the computer labs.

```{r VDI-image, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Glasgow Anywhere Student Desktop", fig.align="center", out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("Images/VirtualDesktop.png")
```

Search for the **RStudio app** within this desktop and launch it. You will then be able to use RStudio in the same way as if it was installed on your own device.
