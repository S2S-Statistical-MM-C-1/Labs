It is possible to access RStudio on the University's Virtual Desktop, called **Glasgow Anywhere Desktop**.\n\nTo do this, follow this [link](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/anywhere/desktop/) and select the '*Connect to Glasgow Anywhere Desktop via your web browser*'. You will need to log in using your student email and password and then select the '*Student Desktop*'. This will open a Windows desktop in your browser - the same one you would see on a PC in the computer labs.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Glasgow Anywhere Student Desktop](Images/VirtualDesktop.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSearch for the **RStudio app** within this desktop and launch it. You will then be able to use RStudio in the same way as if it was installed on your own device.\n",
