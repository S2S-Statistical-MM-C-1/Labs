RStudio essentially makes all features of the R programming language easier to use and it is the software you will interact with, rather than R directly.\n\nIt is best for you to install R and RStudio on your own device and use this throughout your courses.\n\nIf you do not already have R and RStudio downloaded on your device, follow the steps outlined below in [@sec-downloadR] and [@sec-downloadRS] before moving on to [Section @sec-UseR] which will detail how to use RStudio.\n\n## Installing R {#sec-downloadR}\n\n<!-- should there be screenshots of the process?
