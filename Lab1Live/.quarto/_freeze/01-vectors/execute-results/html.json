For example, vectors can store numerical, character (text) or logical (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) data, and be used to easily execute mathematical operations or extract certain elements of the data. For our purposes in S2S, vectors will often contain the values of a particular variable in a dataset.\n\nLet's create some trivial vectors in R to explore their properties. Copy and run the following code in your own R script.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 3\ny <- c(2, 4, 1)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nYou should notice that two '`Values`' appear in the **Environment** tab, `x` and `y`. This is because we have assigned values to each of these names using the `<-` operator in the code above.\n\n-   `x` is the single value 3, which can be thought of as a vector of length 1.\n-   `y` is a vector of length 3 and of the form $\\begin{bmatrix}2&4&1 \\end{bmatrix}^\\intercal$. The function `c()` has been used to '**c**ombine' these values into one vector.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that you can find further details and examples of creating your own vectors in [Section 1.3 Vectors](https://read.kortext.com/reader/pdf/92741/6){target=\"_blank\"} of *Probability and Statistics with R*.\n\n## Addition\n\nWe can also use R to add vectors together. Let's try it out by running the following code.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx + y\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5 7 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe output shown above should appear in the **console** at the bottom left of the RStudio window.\n\nHere, R has 'recycled' the element of the vector `x` until it is the same length as the vector `y`, and elementwise addition has then been completed. This essentially means R has completed $3+2$ to calculate the first element, $3+4$ to find the second and $3+1$ to find the third.\n\nWhat happens if we try to add together two vectors of unequal length, but they both have more than one element? We can try this out by creating a new, longer vector $z=\\begin{bmatrix}3&3&5&8&2\\end{bmatrix}^\\intercal$ and then adding this to `y`.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nz <- c(3, 3, 5, 8, 2)\n\ny + z\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in y + z: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object\nlength\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  5  7  6 10  6\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nWe now see a warning message telling us that the length of vector `z` is not a multiple of the length of vector `y` - in other words, they have a different number of elements. We still see a result however (5, 7, 6, 10, 6) so the vectors have been added together.\n\nThis time, R recycles each element of `y` in turn until it is the same length as `z` and then completes the elementwise addition. `y` has been extended by adding its first two elements on to the end so that it has five entries like `z`, meaning R has completed the calculation $\\begin{bmatrix}2&4&1&2&4\\end{bmatrix}^\\intercal+\\begin{bmatrix}3&3&5&8&2\\end{bmatrix}^\\intercal$.\n\n::: question\n::: question-header\nTask\n:::\n\n::: question-container\nCreate and save the vector $a=\\begin{bmatrix}2&2&-1\\end{bmatrix}^\\intercal$ and scalar $b=2$. Add these together and save the result as a new vector called `c` and print the contents of `c` in the console.\n\n\n````{=html}\n<!--\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Solution</button>\n ::: panel-tabset \\## R Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- c(2, 2, -1)\nb <- 2\n\nc <- a + b\nc\n```\n:::\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4 4 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</div>\n\n-->\n````\n\n:::\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Section 1.3 Vectors](https://read.kortext.com/reader/pdf/92741/6){target=\"_blank\"} of *Probability and Statistics with R* explains in detail how R adds two vectors together.\n\n## Logical operators {#sec-logi}\n\nVectors can contain logical values (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) rather than numerical values. We can create logical vectors by comparing the values within a numerical vector.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nw <- (x < y)\nw\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nHere, R has again recycled the element from `x` to make it the same length as `y`, then it returns a vector telling us for which elements the statement `x < y` is true. For example, the first element of `x` is 3 which is greater than 2, so `x < y` is `FALSE`.\n\nOther logical operators that we can use with vectors include:\n\n| Operator | Function                 |\n|:--------:|:-------------------------|\n|   `>`    | greater than             |\n|   `<`    | less than                |\n|   `<=`   | less than or equal to    |\n|   `>=`   | greater than or equal to |\n|   `==`   | exact equality           |\n|   `!=`   | exact inequality         |\n\nLet's explore how these operators behave with two new numerical vectors.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns <- c(2, 4, 1)\nt <- c(2, 3, 4)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: question\n::: question-header\nTask\n:::\n\n::: question-container\nWrite some code to show:\n\n-   which elements of `s` and `t` are equal to each other\n-   which elements of `s` are less than the corresponding element in `t`\n-   which elements of `s` and `t` are unequal\n\n\n````{=html}\n<!--\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Solution</button>\n When using logical operators with vectors, R will compare the vectors elementwise meaning the first elements of each vector will be compared to each other, then the second elements and so on.\n\n**Equality**:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns == t\n```\n:::\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\nThis tells us that the first element of `s` is equal to the first element of `t` (they are both the value 2), whereas the second elements of `s` and `t` are not equal and neither are the third elements.\n\n**Less than**:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns < t\n```\n:::\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\nThe first element of `s` is not less than the first elements of `t` (that is 2 \\< 2 is not a true statement) so this returns `FALSE`.

The first elements of `s` and `t` are both 2 so they are equal meaning `!=` will return `FALSE`. Since the second elements are 4 and 3 respectively, these are unequal so `!=` returns `TRUE`.\n\nTry using some of the other operators listed above to see if they return the vectors you expect. \n</div>\n\n-->\n````\n\n:::\n:::\n\nWhat if we wanted to compare specific elements of the vectors? We can achieve this by 'indexing' the vector. In other words we choose a single element from the vector that we want to use. This is done by first telling R which vector we want to look at by typing its name and then specifying the element we want by including its position inside square brackets (`[ ]`).\n\nFor example, `s[3]` would extract the third element from `s`, that is the number 1.\n\nThe following code can be used to check whether the second element of `s` is the same as the third element of `t`.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns[2] == t[3]\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: question\n::: question-header\nTask\n:::\n\n::: question-container\nCreate the vectors $u=\\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 4 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}^\\intercal$ and $v=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 5 \\end{bmatrix}^\\intercal$.

Alternatively, you could save `u+v` and `x+y` as new vectors, called something different, using the `<-` operator.\n\n`u+v` is equal to $\\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 4 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}^\\intercal$ so its first element is 5. `x+y` is equal to $\\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 7 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}^\\intercal$ so its first element is also 5. It makes sense then that a `TRUE` statement is returned when checking the equality of the first elements of these two vectors.\n\n**Equality of the third and second elements:**\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(u + v)[3] == (x + y)[2]\n```\n:::\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\nSimilarly, we can see that the third entry of `u+v` is 6 and the second entry of `x+y` is 7. Since these are clearly not equal we would expect R to return a `FALSE` statement when checking their equality, which we can see above. \n</div>\n\n-->\n````\n\n:::\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLook at [Section 1.3 Vectors](https://read.kortext.com/reader/pdf/92741/6){target=\"_blank\"} of *Probability and Statistics with R* for more information on logical operators and vectors.\n\n## Other types of vectors\n\nSo far we have looked at numeric vectors and logical vectors. R can also store vectors with other types of elements, for example a character vector can be used to store strings of text.\n\nThe code below shows how to create a character vector;\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nanimals <- c(\"dog\", \"sheep\", \"cow\", \"horse\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nVectors containing complex numbers can also be created as follows;\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncomplex <- c(2+1i, 0+0i, 3+2i)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe function `typof()` is going to be useful for checking how R has stored the elements of a particular vector.

Let's run some code and see.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(w, y)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0 1 0 2 4 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nHere, `w` is a logical vector and `y` is a numeric vector.

So what's happened?\n\nWhen R combines vectors of different types it will ensure all the elements are of the same type in the resulting vector. This is because vectors need to be stored with all elements being the same type by R. This is done so that all elements are of the most 'complex' type. R considers numeric vectors to be more complex than logical vectors, so when we combine a logical and a numeric vector we will be left with a numeric vector.\n\nThe entries `TRUE` and `FALSE` within the vector `w` therefore need to be presented numerically. A `FALSE` statement will take the value 0 and a `TRUE` statement will take the value 1.\n\nLet's look at combining a numeric vector with a complex vector. Remember that `y` is a numeric vector and `complex` is a vector containing complex numbers.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(y, complex)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2+0i 4+0i 1+0i 2+1i 0+0i 3+2i\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nNow all elements are presented as a complex number.

This can be done using one of the functions\n\n-   `as.logical()`\n-   `as.numeric()`\n-   `as.complex()`\n-   `as.character()`\n\nFor example, if we wanted to change the logical vector `w` to be a numeric vector we could use the following code.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas.numeric(w)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0 1 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nWe again see that `TRUE` statements have been given the value 1 and `FALSE` statements have been given the value 0.\n\nIt is important to ensure that this coercion makes sense to do!

This tells us that each element of the now numeric vector doesn't have a value. R also has the symbol `NaN` (\"Not a Number\") to represent an impossible value (e.g. result of dividing by zero).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo read more about the types of vectors R can handle, see [Section 1.3 Vectors](https://read.kortext.com/reader/pdf/92741/6){target=\"_blank\"} of *Probability and Statistics with R*.\n\n## Indexing vectors {#sec-index}\n\nWe have seen briefly how to index vectors using square brackets `[ ]` but we can now look at indexing in more detail.

If a vector is simply a sequence of numbers (following some pattern), R has some nice functions which will speed up how we create these vectors.\n\nThe operator `:` can be used, e.g `2:8`, to generate a sequence of integers from the number on the left hand side (`2`), up to the number on the right hand side (`8`).\n\nThe following code generates a sequence of integers from 2 up to 8.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2:8\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThis can be useful if we want to extract (or omit) a sequence of elements from a vector which are all next to each other.

A function is a piece of code that tells R to complete some predetermined steps which will depend on the values provided to some 'arguments' within the brackets `( )`. The arguments that the function `seq()` can be provided with are:\n\n-   `from =`: this is the starting value of our sequence (it can be an integer or a non-integer).\n-   `to =`: this is the final value of our sequence (it can be an integer or a non-integer).\n-   `by =`: this is the size of the jump between consecutive numbers in our sequence.\n-   `length.out =`: this is the total number of values we want to be included in our sequence.\n\nHopefully you can see that if we specify each of `to =`, `by =` and `length.out =` then they might not necessarily all match up. Therefore we actually only need to specify two of `to =`, `by =` or `length.out =` within the `seq()` function.\n\nLet's look at some examples of using `seq()`.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseq(from = 2, to = 4, by = 0.2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4.0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseq(from = 3, to = 5, length.out = 9)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.00 3.25 3.50 3.75 4.00 4.25 4.50 4.75 5.00\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseq(from = 4, by = 0.5, length.out = 7)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: question\n::: question-header\nTask\n:::\n\n::: question-container\nWrite some code to create the sequence 4.10, 4.15, 4.20, 4.25, 4.30, 4.35, 4.40 using the function `seq()`\n\n\n````{=html}\n<!--\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Solution</button>\n There are three different ways we could generate this sequence using the `seq()` function.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseq(from = 4.10, to = 4.40, by = 0.05)\n```\n:::\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4.10 4.15 4.20 4.25 4.30 4.35 4.40\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseq(from = 4.10, to = 4.40, length.out = 7)\n```\n:::\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4.10 4.15 4.20 4.25 4.30 4.35 4.40\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseq(from = 4.10, by = 0.05, length.out = 7)\n```\n:::\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4.10 4.15 4.20 4.25 4.30 4.35 4.40\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</div>\n\n-->\n````\n\n:::\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can see additional examples of using the `seq()` function in [Section 1.3.3 Generating Vector Sequences and Repeating Vector Constants](https://read.kortext.com/reader/pdf/92741/11){target=\"_blank\"} of *Probability and Statistics with R*.\n\n## Repeating constants {#repeat}\n\nAnother function in R that's going to be useful is the `rep()` function. This allows us to create a vector which consists of repeated elements, or repeated sequences of elements. The arguments that `rep()` can be provided with are:\n\n-   `x =`: this is the value (or sequence) that we want to be repeated.\n-   `times =`: this is the number of times the value should be repeated - if `x` is a sequence then the full sequence will be repeated this many times.\n-   `each =`: if `x` is a sequence then this is the number of times the first element of the sequence should be repeated before moving on to repeating the second element and so on.\n-   `length.out =`: this is the total number of elements we want to be included in the vector of repeated values.\n\nIf we specify all of `times =`, `each =` and `length.out =`, they might not necessarily be in agreement with each other. Therefore, only one of `times =`, `each =` or `length.out =` needs to be specified.\n\nLet's look at some examples of using `rep()`.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrep(x = 2, times = 6)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2 2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrep(x = 1:3, each = 2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 1 2 2 3 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrep(x = 1:4, times = 1:4)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrep(x = c(TRUE, FALSE), length.out = 8)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: question\n::: question-header\nTask\n:::\n\n::: question-container\nWrite some code to create each of the following repeating sequences using `rep()`:\n\n-   3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5\n-   2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6\n-   blue, blue, blue, red, red\n\n\n````{=html}\n<!--\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Solution</button>\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrep(3:5, times = 3)\n```\n:::\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3 4 5 3 4 5 3 4 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrep(c(2, 4, 6), each = 2)\n```\n:::\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2 2 4 4 6 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrep(c(\"blue\", \"red\"), times=c(3, 2))\n```\n:::\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"blue\" \"blue\" \"blue\" \"red\"  \"red\" \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</div>\n\n-->\n````\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: question\n::: question-header\nTask\n:::\n\n::: question-container\nWrite some code to generate the sequence 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7 using both the `seq()` and `rep()` functions.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Hint</button>\n First of all, notice that the sequence of numbers you want to repeat is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

R contains extensive help files on any function that can be used. To access these, simply put a `?` in front of the function name, or use the function `help()`.\n\nFor example, if we were unsure what the function `rep()` is used for, then we can run either of the following lines of code.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?rep\n\nhelp(rep)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThis tells us in the **Help** tab that the first argument for the `rep()` function is called `x =` and a short description of what should be provided to this argument is given. It also describes the other arguments `times =`, `length.out =` and `each =`.\n\nThe order that arguments appear in in the help file is important because you don't actually need to use the names of the arguments when using a function. Instead, you can just provide the values for each argument, and as long as they are in the same order as they appear in in the help file, R will know which value corresponds to which argument. This is known as using positional arguments.\n\nSometimes you might see a value associated with a specific argument in the help file, for example `x = 5`. This is the \"default\" value for that argument and it means that if you don't specify a different value for the argument, then R will use the default value when executing the function. We'll see more about default values as we encounter more complex functions in future labs.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor more information on accessing the online and inbuilt help in RStudio, see [Section 1.5 Getting Help](https://read.kortext.com/reader/pdf/92741/14){target=\"_blank\"} in *Probability and Statistics with R*.\n",
