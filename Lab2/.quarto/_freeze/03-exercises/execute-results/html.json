These data have been collected under the Scotland River Temperature Monitoring Network (SRTMN) project.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-temptable .cell tbl-cap='Recorded annual mean temperatures across the River Dee in the years 2015 to 2021.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|       | 2015| 2016| 2017| 2018| 2019| 2020| 2021|\n|:------|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|\n|Site 1 |   NA| 6.83| 7.01| 7.03| 6.88| 7.06| 7.28|\n|Site 2 | 5.79| 6.00| 6.25| 6.23| 6.13| 6.25| 6.48|\n|Site 3 | 5.77| 6.28| 6.53| 6.81| 6.36| 6.55| 6.59|\n|Site 4 | 6.14| 6.65| 6.83| 7.07| 6.58| 6.86| 6.92|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSave these data in a matrix called `temps` and make sure to rename the rows and columns of this matrix so they match the row and column names shown in @tbl-temptable.\n\nCalculate the mean of all the temperatures from Site 3 across all seven years.\n\nCalculate the mean of the temperatures across all four sites in 2015.\n\n## Exercise 2 {.unnumbered}\n\nMake sure the package `PASWR2` is installed and loaded in your current RStudio session. From this package, save the data frame `SWIMTIMES` into your **Environment** tab. This data set gives the improvement time (in seconds) for 28 swimmers who were randomly assigned to one of two different diets (see more by running the code `help(\"SWIMTIMES\")`).\n\nExplore the structure of the variables of this data set and change the labels for the levels of the factor `diet` to be `high` and `low`.\n\nWhat is the mean improvement time for swimmers who were on a high fat diet?\n\n## Exercise 3 {.unnumbered}\n\nMercedes has decided to keep track of different aspects of their life. Below are their notes recording their daily steps, some of their expenses and their most recent exam results.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Images/notes.png){width=1393}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCreate three separate data frames, one for each of these notes, that stores the information shown above. Call them `steps`, `expenses` and `grades` respectively.\n\nThen, combine these data frames into a single list so that Mercedes can easily continue to track these parts of their life.\n\nCan you write code to show only the expenses from 14/08, using the list you have created?\n",
