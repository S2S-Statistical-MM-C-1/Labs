    "text": "2.1.1 Sampling distribution for \\(\\bar X\\)\nBecause \\(X\\) comes from a finite population, we can list all possible outcomes of sampling from the bag. If we were to sample with replacement, two balls from the bag, then there are 36 different combinations of values that we might see in a single sample. To list these, we can use the function expand.grid()\nThe function expand.grid() works by providing as the arguments the vectors of different outcomes that can occur. In this case, all the possible values that \\(X\\) can take are \\(\\begin{Bmatrix}1&2&3&4&5&6\\end{Bmatrix}\\). The function then returns a data frame which shows all combinations of the different outcomes provided in the arguments. Just like when setting up a data frame, you can call the columns anything you like. Here, because we are drawing a ball from the bag on two occasions, the columns have been named Draw1 and Draw2.\n\nR CodeOutput\n\n\n\nsamples_w &lt;- expand.grid(Draw1 = 1:6, Draw2 = 1:6)\nhead(samples_w)\n\n\n\n\n\n  Draw1 Draw2\n1     1     1\n2     2     1\n3     3     1\n4     4     1\n5     5     1\n6     6     1\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the first row of samples_w shows that the one of the outcomes of drawing two balls from the bag is that the first ball has the value 1 and the second ball also has the value 1. It is clear then that expand.grid() shows the possible outcomes of sampling with replacement.\nBecause we are interested in finding the sampling distributions of the mean, \\(\\bar X\\), and of the variance, \\(S^2\\), it makes sense to calculate what these are for each possible sample from the bag.\nRun the code below to calculate the mean and variance for each draw of two balls from the bag, then update the data frame samples_w to contain this information, as well as the sample these values came from.\n\nR Code\n\n\n\nsample_w_means &lt;- apply(X = samples_w, MARGIN = 1, FUN = mean)\n\nsample_w_variances &lt;- apply(X = samples_w, MARGIN = 1, FUN = var)\n\nsamples_w &lt;- cbind(samples_w, Mean = sample_w_means, Variance = sample_w_variances)\n\n\n\n\nThe information in the data frame samples_w is summarised in Table Table 2.2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Mean and variance for every combination of \\((x_1, x_2)\\) when sampling with replacement, six numbered balls from a bag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\((x_1,\\,x_2)\\)\nMean\nVariance\n\\((x_1,\\,x_2)\\)\nMean\nVariance\n\\((x_1,\\,x_2)\\)\nMean\nVariance\n\n\n\n\n(1, 1)\n1.0\n0.0\n(1, 3)\n2.0\n2.0\n(1, 5)\n3.0\n8.0\n\n\n(2, 1)\n1.5\n0.5\n(2, 3)\n2.5\n0.5\n(2, 5)\n3.5\n4.5\n\n\n(3, 1)\n2.0\n2.0\n(3, 3)\n3.0\n0.0\n(3, 5)\n4.0\n2.0\n\n\n(4, 1)\n2.5\n4.5\n(4, 3)\n3.5\n0.5\n(4, 5)\n4.5\n0.5\n\n\n(5, 1)\n3.0\n8.0\n(5, 3)\n4.0\n2.0\n(5, 5)\n5.0\n0.0\n\n\n(6, 1)\n3.5\n12.5\n(6, 3)\n4.5\n4.5\n(6, 5)\n5.5\n0.5\n\n\n(1, 2)\n1.5\n0.5\n(1, 4)\n2.5\n4.5\n(1, 6)\n3.5\n12.5\n\n\n(2, 2)\n2.0\n0.0\n(2, 4)\n3.0\n2.0\n(2, 6)\n4.0\n8.0\n\n\n(3, 2)\n2.5\n0.5\n(3, 4)\n3.5\n0.5\n(3, 6)\n4.5\n4.5\n\n\n(4, 2)\n3.0\n2.0\n(4, 4)\n4.0\n0.0\n(4, 6)\n5.0\n2.0\n\n\n(5, 2)\n3.5\n4.5\n(5, 4)\n4.5\n0.5\n(5, 6)\n5.5\n0.5\n\n\n(6, 2)\n4.0\n8.0\n(6, 4)\n5.0\n2.0\n(6, 6)\n6.0\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can then use the information contained in samples_w (or in Table 2.2) to construct the sampling distribution for the mean, \\(\\bar X\\). The sampling distribution will tell us all the values that \\(\\bar X\\) can take and the probability with which it takes each value.\nRun the code below to create the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar X\\). This is done by dividing the number of times \\(\\bar X\\) takes each of its possible values by 36 (because we know that there are 36 possible combinations of two balls from the bag and that each combination is equally likely, so any combination has a probability of occurring of \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\)).\nThe function fractions() is used to force R to show these calculated probabilities as a fraction, rather than as a number with many decimal places. The fractions() function is part of a package called MASS so it is necessary to load this into your R session using the code library(MASS).\n\nR CodeOutput\n\n\n\nlibrary(MASS)\n\nsamplingdist_mean_w &lt;- fractions(table(samples_w$Mean)/36)\nsamplingdist_mean_w\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   1  1.5    2  2.5    3  3.5    4  4.5    5  5.5    6 \n1/36 1/18 1/12  1/9 5/36  1/6 5/36  1/9 1/12 1/18 1/36 \n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, \\(\\bar X\\) is equal to 1.5 on two occasions (if the balls drawn are (2, 1) or (1, 2)). We can then say that \\(P\\big(\\bar X=1.5\\big)=\\frac{2}{36}=\\frac{1}{18}\\).\n\n\nTask\n\n\nWhat is the mean of the sampling distribution for \\(\\bar X\\)?\n\\(\\mu_{\\bar X}=\\) \n\n\nSolution\n\nThe mean can be found by finding the expected value of the sampling distribution for \\(\\bar X\\). The expected value of a discrete random variable \\(X\\) with \\(N\\) discrete values can be found using,\n\\[\n\\mu_X=E[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^N x_iP(X=x_i)\n\\]\nFor the case of \\(\\bar X\\), the mean can then be calculated as,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_{\\bar X}&=1\\times\\frac{1}{36}+1.5\\times\\frac{1}{18}+2\\times\\frac{1}{12}+\\dots+6\\times\\frac{1}{36}\\\\\n&=\\frac{7}{2}=3.5\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] We can do exactly the same thing using R code. First, we need to extract all the individual values that \\(\\bar X\\) can take. This is done by first using the names() function, which extracts each \\(\\bar X\\) value from samplingdist_mean_w because it is a table with named entries, and then by switching these ‘names’ to be numbers using as.numeric() because R initially views the numbers as characters.\nWe then want to multiply each of these values by the corresponding probability that \\(\\bar X\\) takes that value, as shown in the sampling distribution samplingdist_mean_w, and then sum together these products using the sum() function.\n\nR CodeOutput\n\n\n\nmeans_w &lt;- as.numeric(names(samplingdist_mean_w))\nmean_Xbar_w &lt;- sum(means_w*samplingdist_mean_w)\nmean_Xbar_w\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 7/2\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we see that \\(\\mu_{\\bar X}=\\frac{7}{2}=3.5\\).\n\n\nFurther\n\nNote that the value of \\(\\mu_{\\bar X}\\) is the same as the mean of the random variable \\(X\\), \\(\\mu_X\\). This makes sense because,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_{\\bar X}=E[\\bar X]&=E\\bigg[\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}\\bigg]\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i]\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\mu_X\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{n}\\cdot n\\mu_X=\\mu_X\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nprovided each \\(X_i\\) is independent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\nWhat is the variance of the sampling distribution for \\(\\bar X\\)?\n\\(\\sigma^2_{\\bar X}=\\) \n\n\nSolution\n\nIn order to find the variance of a random variable \\(X\\) with a discrete distribution with \\(N\\) discrete values, we can use the formula,\n\\[\n\\sigma^2_X=Var(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2P(X=x_i)-(\\mu_X)^2\n\\]\nSo for the variance of the mean, \\(\\bar X\\), we can calculate this as,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma^2_{\\bar X}&=\\bigg(1^2\\times\\frac{1}{36}+1.5^2\\times\\frac{1}{18}+\\dots +6^2\\times\\frac{1}{36}\\bigg)-(3.5)^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{35}{24}\\approx1.4583\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can also calculate the same thing in R. To do this, the unique values that \\(\\bar X\\) can take are extracted from samplingdist_mean_w, again using the functions names() and as.numeric(). These are then squared and multiplied by the corresponding probability that \\(\\bar X\\) takes this value. The sum() function is used to sum all of these products, and then \\((\\mu_{\\bar X})^2\\), stored in mean_Xbar_w, is subtracted.\n\nR CodeOutput\n\n\n\nmeans_w &lt;- as.numeric(names(samplingdist_mean_w))\nvar_Xbar_w &lt;- sum(means_w^2*samplingdist_mean_w)-(mean_Xbar_w)^2\nvar_Xbar_w\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 35/24\n\n\n\n\n\nThis confirms that \\(\\sigma^2_{\\bar X}=\\frac{35}{24}\\approx 1.4583\\).\n\n\nFurther\n\nNote that the variance of the sampling distribution for the mean is the variance of the random variable \\(X\\) divided by the size of our sample (\\(n=2\\)). That is, \\(\\sigma^2_{\\bar X}=\\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{n}\\). We can prove this is true since,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma_{\\bar X}^2=Var(\\bar X)&=Var\\bigg(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}\\bigg)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i=1}^nVar(X_i)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sigma_X^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{n^2}\\cdot n\\sigma_X^2=\\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nprovided each \\(X_i\\) is independent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Sampling distribution of \\(S^2\\)\nWe are also able to find the sampling distribution for the variance, \\(S^2\\). We again find the number of times the sample variance is equal to each of the distinct values it can take, and divide this by 36. The function fractions() is again used to show these probabilities as fractions. Note that we don’t need to run library(MASS) this time, because the MASS package is already loaded into our R session.\n\nR CodeOutput\n\n\n\nsamplingdist_var_w &lt;- fractions(table(samples_w$Variance)/36)\nsamplingdist_var_w\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   0  0.5    2  4.5    8 12.5 \n 1/6 5/18  2/9  1/6  1/9 1/18 \n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see that \\(P(S^2=12.5)=\\frac{1}{18}\\) which we could have calculated from Table 2.2 since the sample variance is equal to 12.5 for only two outcomes (when the balls drawn are (6, 1) or (1, 6)), so the probability \\(S^2\\) takes the value 12.5 is equal to \\(\\frac{2}{36}=\\frac{1}{18}\\).\n\n\nTask\n\n\nWhat is the mean of the sampling distribution for \\(S^2\\)?\n\\(\\mu_{S^2}=\\) \n\n\nSolution\n\nIn order to find the mean of a variable \\(X\\) with a discrete distribution with \\(N\\) discrete values, we can use,\n\\[\n\\mu_X=E[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^N x_iP(X=x_i)\n\\]\nFor the sample variance, we can then calculate the expected value as,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_{S^2}&=0\\times\\frac{1}{6}+0.5\\times\\frac{5}{18}+2\\times\\frac{2}{9}+\\dots+12.5\\times\\frac{1}{18}\\\\\n&=\\frac{35}{12}\\approx 2.9166\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis can be found in R using the following code.\n\nR CodeOutput\n\n\n\nvars_w &lt;- as.numeric(names(samplingdist_var_w))\nmean_S2_w &lt;- sum(vars_w*samplingdist_var_w)\nmean_S2_w\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 35/12\n\n\n\n\n\nThis again shows that \\(\\mu_{S^2}=\\frac{35}{12}\\approx 2.9166\\). Note that this is equal to the variance of the random variable \\(X\\), \\(\\sigma^2_{\\bar X}\\).",

Now there are only \\({6\\choose 2}=15\\) possible outcomes of two balls from the bag of six. We can list all of these possible outcomes with the code below.\nHere, we use the function srs() (which stands for simple random sample) to list these outcomes. This function takes the arguments,\n\npopvalues =: this is a vector of all values seen in the population.\nn =: this is the size of the sample to be taken without replacement from the population.\n\nThe srs() function is part of the PASWR2 package, so it is necessary to run the code library(PASWR2).

Once again, fractions() shows these values as rational numbers.\n\nR CodeOutput\n\n\n\nsamplingdist_var_wo &lt;- fractions(table(samples_wo$Variance)/15)\nsamplingdist_var_wo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 0.5    2  4.5    8 12.5 \n 1/3 4/15  1/5 2/15 1/15 \n\n\n\n\n\nThis distribution states that when sampling without replacement, the probability that the variance of a sample of two balls out of six is equal to 8, for example, is \\(\\frac{2}{15}\\) i.e. \\(P(S^2=8)=\\frac{2}{15}\\).\n\n\nTask\n\n\nWhat is the expected value of the sampling distribution for \\(S^2\\), when sampling without replacement?\n\\(E[S^2]=\\) \n\n\nSolution\n\nThe formula to use here is,\n\\[\n\\mu_X=E[X]=\\sum_{i=1}^N x_iP(X=x_i)\n\\]\nThe expected value of the sample variance is then,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE[S^2]&=0.5\\times\\frac{1}{3}+2\\times\\frac{4}{15}+4.5\\times\\frac{1}{5}+\\dots+12.5\\times\\frac{1}{15}\\\\\n&=\\frac{7}{2}= 3.5\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can find the same result in R using the following code.\n\nR CodeOutput\n\n\n\nvars_wo &lt;- as.numeric(names(samplingdist_var_wo))\nmean_S2_wo &lt;- sum(vars_wo*samplingdist_var_wo)\nmean_S2_wo\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 7/2\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows us once again that \\(E[S^2]=\\frac{7}{2}=3.5\\).\nThe relationship between the expected value of the sample variance, when sampling without replacement, and the variance of the random variable \\(X\\) can be summarised with the formula,\n\\[\nE[S^2]=\\frac{N}{N-1}\\cdot\\sigma_X^2\n\\]\n\n\n\nWe can summarise all of the results we’ve seen so far about the sampling distributions of \\(\\bar X\\) and \\(S^2\\), when sampling with or without replacement, in Table 2.4.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: Summary of properties of the distribution for \\(X\\) and sampling distributions for \\(\\bar X\\) and \\(S^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mu_X\\)\n\\(\\sigma^2_X\\)\n\\(E[\\bar X]\\)\n\\(\\sigma^2_{\\bar X}\\)\n\\(E[S^2]\\)\n\n\n\n\nWith replacement\n3.5\n2.9167\n3.5 \\(=\\mu_X\\)\n1.4583 \\(=\\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{n}\\)\n2.9167 \\(=\\sigma_X^2\\)\n\n\nWithout replacement\n3.5\n2.9167\n3.5 \\(=\\mu_X\\)\n1.1667 \\(=\\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{n}\\cdot\\frac{N-n}{N-1}\\)\n3.5 \\(=\\frac{N}{N-1}\\cdot\\sigma_X^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe expected value of the sample mean is \\(\\mu_X\\), regardless of whether we are sampling with or without replacement. Both the variance of the sample mean and the expected value of the sample variance change though, depending on whether sampling with or without replacement has been used.\n\nTo follow an example of creating the sampling distribution for the mean and for the variance from a finite population, see Section 6.4 Sampling Distribution of \\(\\bar X\\) in Probability and Statistics with R.",
