# Welcome!

On this webpage you will find all the formulas for calculating any **confidence intervals** relating to population means, variances and proportions, as covered in [Chapter 8](https://read.kortext.com/reader/pdf/92741/454){target="_blank"} of *Probability and Statistics with R*.

You will always have access to this lab in assessments, so make sure you are familiar with where to find these formulas.
