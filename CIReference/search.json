    "text": "6.2 Difference in population proportions (8.4.2)\nFor random samples of size \\(n_X\\) and \\(n_Y\\) taken from two normal distributions, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) respectively, then the difference in the population proportions of success, \\(\\pi_X\\) and \\(\\pi_Y\\) may be of interest.\nA \\((1-\\alpha)\\cdot100\\%\\) confidence interval for the difference in population proportions, \\(\\pi_X-\\pi_Y\\), can be calculated based on the difference in sample proportions, \\(p_X-p_Y\\), as,\n\n\\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{8.52}\n\\begin{split}\nCI_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}(\\pi_X-\\pi_Y)=\\Bigg[&(p_X-p_Y)-z_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}\\cdot\\sqrt{\\frac{p_X(1-p_X)}{n_X}+\\frac{p_Y(1-p_Y)}{n_Y}},\\\\\n&\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,(p_X-p_Y)+z_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}\\cdot\\sqrt{\\frac{p_X(1-p_X)}{n_X}+\\frac{p_Y(1-p_Y)}{n_Y}}\\Bigg]\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nIf \\(|p_X-p_Y|&gt;\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{n_X}+\\frac{1}{n_Y}\\right)\\), then a continuity correction is generally applied to the above formula. When this condition is satisfied, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{n_X}+\\frac{1}{n_Y}\\right)\\) is subtracted from the lower limit of the confidence interval above, and added to the upper limit.\nThe function prop.test() uses this continuity correction automatically whenever the condition is satisfied by the difference in sample proportions.\n\nSee Section 8.4.2 of Probability and Statistics with R for some examples of using this result.",
