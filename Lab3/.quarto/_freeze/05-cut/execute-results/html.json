For example, if we wanted to identify high, mid and low levels of `hdl` in `chol_full`.\n\nThe function that can do this in R is `cut()`. The arguments that `cut()` takes are:\n\n* `x =`: this is the numeric variable that you want to split into different levels.\n* `breaks =`: this is the number of levels you want to split the numeric vector into.\n* `include.lowest =`: this takes the values `TRUE` or `FALSE`, indicating whether the lowest value in the numeric variable should be included in the first level. By default this is set to `FALSE` so this smallest value is not included.\n\nWe can split `hdl` into three levels using the following code.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncut(x = chol_full$hdl, breaks = 3, include.lowest = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] [24.9,55.7] [24.9,55.7] (55.7,86.3] [24.9,55.7] (86.3,117]  [24.9,55.7]\n [7] (55.7,86.3] (55.7,86.3] [24.9,55.7] [24.9,55.7] (55.7,86.3] (86.3,117] \n[13] [24.9,55.7] (55.7,86.3]\nLevels: [24.9,55.7] (55.7,86.3] (86.3,117]\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThis tells us that the lowest level is the range [24.9, 55.7], the middle level is (55.7, 86.3] and the highest level is (86.3, 117]. We can also see which level each row falls into, the first two rows being in the low level for `hdl`, the third row being in the middle level and so on.\n\nWe can then add this as a new factor variable, `hdl_level`, and represent each level with the labels `\"low\"`, `\"mid\"` and `\"high\"` using the code below.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchol_full$hdl_level <- factor(cut(x = chol_full$hdl, breaks = 3, include.lowest = TRUE),\n                              labels = c(\"low\", \"mid\", \"high\"))\n\nhead(chol_full)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    id ldl hdl trig age gender     smoke weight height      bmi hdl_level\n1 P912 175  25  148  39 female        no  90.77   1.69 31.78110       low\n2 P215 196  36   92  32 female        no  75.06   1.75 24.50939       low\n3 P063 139  65   NA  42   male      <NA>  73.99   1.84 21.85432       mid\n4 P117 162  37  139  30 female ex-smoker  86.25   1.83 25.75473       low\n5 P613 140 117   59  42 female ex-smoker  76.95   1.81 23.48829      high\n6 P332 147  51  126  65 female ex-smoker  57.66   1.75 18.82776       low\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n",
