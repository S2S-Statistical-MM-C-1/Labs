In order to do this, we need to make use of the **asymptotic properties** of maximum likelihood estimators. This states that, provided the sample size $n$ is sufficiently large, then,\n\n$$\n\\hat\\theta(\\boldsymbol{X})\\sim N\\left(\\theta, \\sqrt{I_n(\\theta)^{-1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn other words, as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$, the expected value of the maximum likelihood estimator is equal to the population parameter it is estimating, $\\theta$, and that the standard deviation of the *MLE* is equal to $\\sqrt{I_n(\\theta)^{-1}}$.\n\nHere, $I_n(\\theta)$ is the **Fisher Information** for $\\theta$.

The `binom.confint()` function is part of the package `binom`, so make sure to load this package into your R session by using the code `library(binom)`. `binom.confint()` can take the following arguments,\n\n* `x =`: this is the number of Bernoulli trials which were successful i.e. the number of trials for which a 1 is observed. This can be found from a vector of 0s and 1s using the `sum()` function.\n* `n =`: this is the total number of Bernoulli trials included in the sample.\n* `conf.int =`: the is the confidence level for the desired interval. It needs to be put in as a decimal, so for a 95% confidence interval, we would use `0.95` for example.\n* `methods =`: this is the method used to calculate the confidence interval for $\\pi$. To construct a Wald interval, it should be set to `\"asymptotic\"`.\n\nThe code below uses `binom.confint()` to find a 95% Wald interval for the population proportion of statistics students at the University of Glasgow on Santa's naughty list.

This is because with large values of $n$, $\\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2}^2}{2n}$, $\\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2}^2}{4n^2}$ and $\\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2}^2}{n}$ are all approximately 0.\n\n<!--example-->\nWe can calculate a 95% Wilson interval for the population proportion of statistics students at the University of Glasgow who are on Santa's naughty list, $\\pi$, in a couple of different ways. Remember, this sample information is stored in the column `naughty` from the data frame `stats_list`.\n\nBecause the formula for Wilson intervals is quite involved, it is better to use functions in R to find Wilson intervals, rather than using R as a calculator since there are many chances that an error could be made.\n\n:::{.example}\n::::{.example-header}\nMethod 1: Using the `binom.confit()` function\n::::\n::::{.example-container}\nThe `binom.confint()` function from `binom` package can be used to calculate Wilson intervals.

It needs to be put in as a decimal, so for a 95% confidence interval, we would use `0.95` for example.\n* `correct =`: this takes the value `TRUE` or `FALSE` to indicate whether what is known as a Yates' continuity correction should be applied to the estimate for $p$ in the formula. By default, the value `TRUE` is used and this correction is applied. We will be setting this argument to `FALSE` below. You can read more about the Yates' continuity correction in [Section 8.4.1.1](https://read.kortext.com/reader/pdf/92741/496) of the textbook.\n\nThe code below calculates a 95% Wilson interval for the population proportion of statistics students at the University of Glasgow who are on Santa's naughty list, $\\pi$.

That is $\\pi_1-\\pi_2$ where $\\pi_1$ is the population proportion of Level 1 statistics students at the University of Glasgow who are on Santa's naughty list and $\\pi_2$ is the population proportion of Level 2 students on the list. In the dataframe `stats_list`, 184 students are from Level 1 and 126 students are from Level 2.\n\nWe will only consider using the function `prop.test()` can be used to find this 95% confidence interval.\n\n:::{.example}\n::::{.example-header}\nMethod 1: Using the `prop.test()` function\n::::\n::::{.example-container}\nWe need to be careful about how we provide the relevant sample proportions of success $p_1$ and $p_2$ to the `x =` argument. Because we are testing for a difference between two population proportions, we want to provide as the `x =` argument a matrix which contains in the first column a count of the number of successes (i.e. the number of students on the naughty list) in each group, and in the second column a count of the number of failures (i.e. the number of students *not* on the naughty list).\n\nThis matrix, `stats_list_counts` can be set up using the code below which makes use of several functions we've seen before, notable the `sum()`, `subset()` and `matrix()` functions. Try to break down the code and run functions individually to see what's going on.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## R Code\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nlevel1_naughty <- sum(subset(x = stats_list,\n                             subset = level == \"Level 1\")$naughty)\nlevel1_notnaughty <- 184 - level1_naughty\n\nlevel2_naughty <- sum(subset(x = stats_list,\n                             subset = level == \"Level 2\")$naughty)\nlevel2_notnaughty <- 126 - level2_naughty\n\nstats_list_counts <- matrix(data = c(level1_naughty, level1_notnaughty,\n                                     level2_naughty, level2_notnaughty),\n                            nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)\nstats_list_counts\n```\n\n## Output\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nlevel1_naughty <- sum(subset(x = stats_list,\n                             subset = level == \"Level 1\")$naughty)\nlevel1_notnaughty <- 184 - level1_naughty\n\nlevel2_naughty <- sum(subset(x = stats_list,\n                             subset = level == \"Level 2\")$naughty)\nlevel2_notnaughty <- 126 - level2_naughty\n\nstats_list_counts <- matrix(data = c(level1_naughty, level1_notnaughty,\n                                     level2_naughty, level2_notnaughty),\n                            nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)\nstats_list_counts\n```\n:::\n\nNote that we could have used the `table()` function to create a table with these same values in it, which could also be provided as the `x =` argument in the `prop.test()` function. The reason we're not using `table()` here is because the the first column in the resulting table would give a count of the number of Level 1 and Level 2 students who are **not** on the naughty list and the resulting confidence interval would be for the difference in population proportions of Level 1 and Level 2 statistics students who are **not** on Santa's naughty list.\n\nNow the matrix `stats_list_counts` can be used within `prop.test()` to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference in population proportions of Level 1 and Level 2 statistics students at the University of Glasgow who are on Santa's naughty list. Because the matrix contains information on the sample sizes, we don't need to include the `n =` argument in `prop.test()` in this case.
