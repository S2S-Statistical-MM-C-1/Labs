# Dimensions of matrices {#sec-dim}

```{r births, echo = FALSE}
data <- c(5033, 4899, 4683, 6852, 6548, 6553, 2402, 2337, 2260, 1493, 1488, 1417)

births <- matrix(data = data, nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)

cities <- c("Edinburgh", "Glasgow", "Aberdeen", "Dundee")
years <- c("2017", "2018", "2019")

dimnames(births) <- list(cities, years)
```

<!-- avoid dimension reduction with drop=FALSE -->

When extracting an entire row or column using `[ ]`, the object that R returns is a vector rather than a matrix. This means that we can't use some functions that only work for matrices (or arrays).

For example, the code below returns the value `NULL` when using the `dim()` function. `dim()` should return the dimensions of an array, but since the extracted row for births in Edinburgh is a vector, there are no dimensions to return.

::: panel-tabset
## R Code

```{r mat9.1, eval = FALSE}
dim(births["Edinburgh", ])
```

## Output

```{r mat9.2, echo = FALSE}
dim(births["Edinburgh", ])
```
:::

If we want to know how many elements are in a vector, we use the function `length()`.

::: panel-tabset
## R Code

```{r mat9.1.1, eval = FALSE}
length(births["Edinburgh", ])
```

## Output

```{r mat9.1.2, echo = FALSE}
length(births["Edinburgh", ])
```
:::

We can force the output from subseting a matrix/array to be a matrix/array by including a third argument, `drop = FALSE`, within the square brackets to keep the returned row as a matrix/array.

::: panel-tabset
## R Code

```{r mat10.1, eval = FALSE}
dim(births["Edinburgh", , drop = FALSE])
```

## Output

```{r mat10.2, echo = FALSE}
dim(births["Edinburgh", , drop = FALSE])
```
:::

Now we can see that the row is seen as a 1 $\times$ 3 matrix by R.
